# OC_04_ChessTournament

WIP !!!  :construction_worker:

# ● Project Description  
This script will help your local chess club with tournament management.
You can hold and manage a player db, and host a tournament. Registered players will be randomly chosen for the first match, next matches will also be random but also promoting higher ranks to compete each other while avoiding repetitions.
Tournaments are saved autonomously locally after each match, you can quit the program and come back at a later time to resume a pending tournament.
You can also generate all sorts of reports to visualise your database and other results, with local output aswell.
